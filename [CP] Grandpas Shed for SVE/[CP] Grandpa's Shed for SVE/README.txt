Thank you for downloading this mod!

I'd like to credit Elle (junimods) https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/junimods/about-me?gameId=1303
as style inspiration for my mod! I created this to work with her buildings mod so they'd look good together,
but I've added a fair amount of my own touches!

There's color options and as well as decor options, which I will be adding assets to as I go!
